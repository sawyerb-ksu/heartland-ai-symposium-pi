# Build Your Own Pi Skill: Fill-In Guid

Answer five short sets of questions and you'll have a working SKILL.md for a task you do over and over. It takes about 20 minutes.

A **skill** is a folder with one file, SKILL.md, that teaches an agent like Pi how to do one job your way. The top of the file tells Pi *when* to use it. The rest tells Pi *how*. The same file works in Pi, Claude, Codex, Copilot and other agents that support skills.

**How to use this guide:** fill in each blank in Steps 1–4, then copy your answers into the template in Step 5. If you get stuck, the scan-renamer example at the end shows every blank filled in.

## Step 1: Pick a task

The best first skill is a task you already do the same way every time and could explain to a new colleague in a few minutes.

| Good first skills                            | Harder first skills                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Turn meeting notes into action items         | "Help me with my job" (too broad)                 |
| Rename scanned files by date                 | Anything that needs judgment you can't write down |
| Draft a weekly status update from a template | Anything that touches student or patron records   |
| Check a web page for broken links            | Tasks you only do once a year                     |

**The task I do over and over:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**How often I do it:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What "done right" looks like:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Step 2: Name it and say when to use it

Pi reads only the name and description up front. The description is how Pi decides whether your skill fits a request, so it needs both *what* the skill does and *when* to use it.

**Name** (lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens only, like `weekly-status`): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What it does** (one sentence, starting with a verb): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Use it when someone asks for** (list the words people actually say, like "to-dos", "follow-ups", "next steps"): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Tip: if Pi doesn't pick up your skill on its own, the description is usually the problem. Add more of the words people use.

## Step 3: Say what goes in and what comes out

Be specific about where things are and what the result should look like. "A table with these columns" beats "a summary."

**Pi should read from** (a folder, a file type, a web page): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Pi should produce** (a table, a list, an email draft, renamed files): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**It should include** (columns, headings or fields): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Save it to** (a file name, or "just reply in chat"): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Step 4: Write the steps and the rules

Write the steps the way you'd explain the job to a new colleague: short, in order, one action each. Then add the rules a newcomer would get wrong.

**The steps, in order:**

1. ---
2. ---
3. ---
4. ---

**Rules Pi must follow** (what to skip, what never to guess, how to handle missing information):

- ---
- ---

**When it's done, Pi should reply with** (a one-line count, a summary, a question): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Tip: one rule almost every skill needs is "Don't invent anything. If the information isn't there, say so."

Tip: if your skill changes files, have Pi show its plan and wait for your "yes" first. Also have it keep a record of what it changed so you can undo it.

## Step 5: Put it together and test it

Copy your answers into this template and save it as **SKILL.md**.

```markdown
---
name: [Step 2: name]
description: [Step 2: what it does]. Use when [Step 2: the words people say].
---

# [A short title]

1. Read [Step 3: where Pi reads from].
2. [Step 4: step 1]
3. [Step 4: step 2]
4. [Step 4: step 3]
5. Produce [Step 3: what Pi produces] with [Step 3: columns or fields].
6. Save it to [Step 3: file name].

## Rules

- [Step 4: rule 1]
- [Step 4: rule 2]

When you're done, reply with [Step 4: the reply].
```

**Where to save it.** Make a folder with the same name as your skill and put SKILL.md inside it:

| Folder                                                | Who it's for                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `.agents/skills/<name>/` inside your project folder | That project only. Also works in other agents. |
| `~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>/`                        | You, in every folder                           |

**Test it:**

- [ ] Start `pi` in your project folder and say **yes** when it asks to trust the project
- [ ] Ask for the task in your own words. Did Pi pick up the skill?
- [ ] If not, run `/skill:<name>` to load it directly, then improve the description
- [ ] Check the output against the source. Did Pi invent anything?
- [ ] Change one rule, run `/reload` and ask again

## Worked example: rename scanned files

This is the skill from today's exercise, with every blank filled in.

| Blank                        | Answer                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task                         | Give badly named scans clear, consistent names                                  |
| Name                         | `scan-renamer`                                                                  |
| What it does                 | Rename scanned files to clear, consistent names using the scanning log          |
| Use it when someone asks for | rename, clean up, organize or fix the names of scans, photos or PDFs            |
| Read from                    | `scanning-log.csv` and the files in the `scans/` folder                         |
| Produce / include            | New names like `DATE_collection_title.ext`, plus a plan table to approve first  |
| Save to                      | `rename-log.md`, a record of old and new names so the renames can be undone     |
| Rules                        | Only rename, never delete. Skip files not in the log. Don't guess dates.        |
| Reply with                   | How many files were renamed, skipped and missing                                |

# Rename scanned files

1. Read `scanning-log.csv`. Each row lists a file in the `scans/` folder with its date, collection and title.
2. List every file in the `scans/` folder.
3. Build a new name for each file with this pattern: `DATE_collection_title.ext`
   - DATE: a full date becomes YYYY-MM-DD, a month and year becomes YYYY-MM, a year stays YYYY, and a blank date becomes `undated`.
   - collection and title: lowercase, words joined with hyphens, no spaces or punctuation.
   - Keep the original file extension.
4. Show a table of the plan with these columns: Current name, New name, Status (Rename, Skip or Missing). Then stop and ask: "Rename these files?"
5. Only after the user says yes, rename the files.
6. Save a record to `rename-log.md`: a table of Old name and New name, so the renames can be undone.

## Rules

- Only rename. Never delete, overwrite or edit what's inside a file.
- Only touch files inside the `scans/` folder.
- If a file isn't in the log, leave it alone and mark it Skip.
- If the log lists a file that isn't in the folder, mark it Missing.
- Don't guess dates or titles. Use only what the log says.
- If two files would get the same name, add `-2`, `-3` and so on to the later ones.

When you're done, reply with one line: how many files were renamed, skipped and missing.
```

## Before you use it for real

- Practice on made-up data first, like the scans in today's kit.
- Keep student and patron records out of any AI tool that isn't on the approved local cluster.
- Only trust skills you've read. A skill can tell the agent to run scripts or change files.
